# Small-C
This is a full development environment with source code for 16-bit MS-DOS.

The Small-C Compiler, Assembler, and Libraries were written by Jim Hendrix,
building on on initial draft of the compiler by Ron Cain. These works were
initially published in Dr. Dobbs Journal in the early 1980s. Jim Hendrix's
website is [deturbulator.org](http://www.deturbulator.org/Jim.asp).
